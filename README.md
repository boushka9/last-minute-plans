Designed to generate recipes and movie suggestions, you have the option of generating a set of plans specific to a cuisine and a genre respectively.

If you're "feeling frisky," click the button to generate a random combination of movie and recipe and let fate decide!

Find something you love? Click the favorites button to save a movie or recipe you'd like to revisit. Clicking the (MY FAVORITES) button will bring you to all the movies and recipes that you've saved in the past so you can find them easily.
